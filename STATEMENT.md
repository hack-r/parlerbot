Statement from the Author
-------------------------

  Socialism is the greatest evil of all time. With it comes losses of freedom, 
individualism, fake news, terrorism and indoctrination. Social media has 
played a major role in the socialist takeover of the United States. Rejecting
socialist-controlled social media platforms is paramount to preserving your
remaining freedoms.
